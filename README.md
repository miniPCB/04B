# 04B – Transistor Amplifiers Collection

The **Transistor Amplifiers Collection** is a set of educational circuit boards designed to support first- and second-semester electronics courses focused on analog circuit design and transistor operation.

## Included Circuits

This collection includes five foundational amplifier configurations:

- Common Emitter  
- Common Base  
- Cascode  
- Cascade  
- Cascode-Cascade

Each circuit is implemented as a standalone **miniPCB™** with standardized layout, labeling, and interface features for easy integration into lab environments.

## Learning Objectives

These boards are ideal for reinforcing key learning outcomes such as:

- Small-signal modeling  
- Biasing techniques  
- Multistage amplification  
- High-frequency performance enhancements

## Use Cases

The Transistor Amplifiers Collection is suitable for:

- Reinforcement of lecture content  
- Hands-on lab experimentation  
- Homework circuit validation

## Standard Pinout

All boards in the collection follow a consistent 5-pin interface:

1. **GND** – Ground reference  
2. **V+** – Positive power supply  
3. **V− (optional)** – Negative power supply (used in some circuits)  
4. **Input** – Signal input  
5. **Output** – Signal output
